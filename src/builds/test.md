One of the most asked questions now-a-days (special thanks to Elon) is `Are we in Simulation? `. My thought/answer upon this is that it's contradicting. Imagine a coin, it has two phases head and a tail , like that an argument also has points that lie towards and away. 
So first What is Simulation?
In simplest manner we can explain simulation as a world with limitless boundaries which evolve with time. In this world we can do anything we wanted to do or wanted to be.
The term evolution serves a greatest purpose here. Evolution always takes place with a starting model and is limited by the component or processing time. If we compare the `real world` or the universe we are in, the starting model here was the big bang and the limiting factor was time. But this time also works in duality which the elapse of time the universe evolved, cooling of universe, creating of blackhole , attraction of matters , creating of planets ,first organisms , human life …… current situation. If we look 100 years ago we never imagined the world today, like communication overseas with the help of phones , travelling becoming so easy ,digital money. Many times this makes me believe that we are simulation. If I was asked the same question 100 years ago, I would deny the fact. The belief upon simulation is proportional to time with upcoming technical and biological evolution.
